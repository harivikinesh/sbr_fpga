## Control Systems on FPGA

This hobby project aims to build a two-wheel self balancing robot to learn control systems and implement them on the FPGA to exploit the boards potential.

### Hardware Used

1. De0 Nano Board
2. MPU9250 Sensor
3. N20 Motors with Encoder
4. L298n Motor Driver
5. Level Shifter
